title: Work permits for H4B
---


<div class="message">
Federal goverment announced earlier this year that sposes of H1B visa holders like yours truly will be eligible to work in these united states
</div>

I felt like writing to thank the teams who lobbied for such a change and indeed the US government for realizing that:

- Majority of the H4B visa holders are women.</a>
- They are highly educated.
- They produce way more jobs for the market than they consume.

If you go through [this](http://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a8218/h4-visa-debate-beyond-borders) article, you might read between the lines and draw similar conclusions as I point out above.
